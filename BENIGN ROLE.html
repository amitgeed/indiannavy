	<h2> BENIGN ROLE</h2>
			<img id="i2" src="images/benign-role.jpg" alt="img"/>

	<p>
The ‘benign’ role is so named because violence has no part to play in its execution, nor is the potential to apply force a necessary prerequisite for undertaking these operations. Examples of benign tasks include humanitarian aid, disaster relief, Search and Rescue (SAR), ordnance disposal, diving assistance, salvage operations, Hydrographic surveys, etc. Maritime forces, because of their quick mobilization, are extremely useful in the early stages of a crisis for providing relief material, first aid and succour. Much of the capacity to perform these functions derives itself from the mobility, reach and endurance inherent in naval task forces, coupled with their SeaLift capability. For example, in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster, one of the biggest challenges is the disbursement of food, water and relief material. It is under such conditions that military mobility, coupled with reliable communications are most effective in ensuring distribution to even the most remote afflicted areas. While specialized civilian agencies may take over at a later stage, maritime forces can provide the first helping hand and may be deployed to complement their efforts. The ICG is the designated national agency for SAR. Naval units may also be called upon to undertake SAR operations, as required.
