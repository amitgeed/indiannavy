	<h2>CONSTABULARY ROLE</h2>
			<img id="i2" src="images/constabulary-role.jpg" alt="img"/>

	<p>
The increasing incidence of maritime crime has brought into sharp focus the constabulary role that
 navies have to perform. The significance of this role may be Gauged from the fact that for a third 
 of the world’s navies, this is a major facet of their functions. In the constabulary role, forces are
 employed to enforce law of the land or to implement a regime established by an international mandate.
 Force is only employed for self-defense or as a last resort in execution of this role. The protection 
 and promotion of India’s maritime security is one of the prime responsibilities of the Indian Navy. This

 includes a constabulary element, especially where it relates to threats that involve use of force at sea.
 The range of tasks that the IN has to undertake in the constabulary role ranges from Low Intensity Maritime 
 Operations (LIMO) to maintaining good order at sea. This further includes aspects of coastal security, as part

 of India’s overall maritime security. Constabulary tasks at sea are neither the primary nor the sole mandate of
 the IN. With the establishment of the ICG in February 1978, law enforcement aspects of the constabulary role within
 the Maritime Zones of India (MZI) have been transferred to the ICG.28 Security in major harbors and ports are the
 purview of the port authorities, aided by customs and immigration agencies. Constabulary tasks beyond the MZI are
 vested with the Indian Navy. Efficient and effective maritime constabulary requires proper and seamless coordination 
 between the various maritime law enforcement and regulatory agencies. After the terrorist attacks on Mumbai on 26 November
 2008, the overall responsibility for coastal security has been mandated
 to the Indian Navy, in close coordination with the ICG, State marine police and other central/state government and port authorities.
