	<h2> ABOUT US </h2>
	<p>
		

The Indian Navy (IN; IAST: Bhāratīya Nau Senā) is the naval branch of the Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the 
	Supreme Commander of the Indian Navy. The Chief of Naval Staff, a four-star Admiral, commands the navy.<br>

The Indian Navy traces its origins back to the East India Company's Marine which was founded in 
1612 to protect British merchant shipping in the region. In 1793, the East India Company established 
its rule over eastern part of the Indian subcontinent i.e. Bengal, but it was not until 1830 that the colonial navy was titled
 as His Majesty's Indian Navy. When India became a republic in 1950, the Royal Indian Navy as
 it had been named since 1934 was renamed to Indian Navy.<br><br>

The primary objective of the navy is to safeguard the nation's maritime borders, and in
 conjunction with other Armed Forces of the union, act to deter or defeat any threats or
 aggression against the territory, people or maritime interests of India, both in war and
 peace. Through joint exercises, goodwill visits and humanitarian missions, including disaster
 relief, Indian Navy promotes bilateral relations between nations.<br><br>
