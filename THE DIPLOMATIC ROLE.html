	<h2> THE DIPLOMATIC ROLE  </h2>
		<img id="i2" src="images/the-diplomatic-role (1).jpg" alt="img"/>

	<p>
	Naval Diplomacy entails the use of naval forces in support of 
	foreign policy objectives to build ‘bridges of friendship’ and
	strengthen international cooperation on the one hand, and to signal
	capability and intent to deter potential adversaries on the other. 
	The larger purpose of the navy’s diplomatic role is to favorably 
	shape the maritime environment in the furtherance of national interests,
	in consonance with the foreign policy and national security objectives.
	Navies inherently lean towards performing a diplomatic role on account of 
	two characteristics. The first is their status as comprehensive instruments 
	of a country’s sovereign power, whereupon their very presence in or off 
	a certain area signals the nation’s political intent and commitment to pursue
	national interests in that region. Hence, their presence or absence can 
	be calibrated to send a political message to potential friends and foes 
	alike. The second characteristic facilitating the navy’s diplomatic role 
	is in the very attributes of maritime forces, including access, mobility,
	sustenance, reach, flexibility and versatility. These combine to offer a variety
	of tools for furthering national interests and pursuing foreign policy
	goals. Naval forces can be readily deployed, can perform multiple roles and
	tasks that can be calibrated in visibility
	and intensity as per requirements, and can just as easily and rapidly be withdrawn, to send a countersignal.
